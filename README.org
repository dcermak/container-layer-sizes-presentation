* Fosdem 2022 & DevConf 2022: What made your container fat?

This repository contains the slides for my lightning talk at [[https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/container_fat_layers/][FOSDEM 2022]] and [[https://devconfcz2022.sched.com/event/vvxl/ligtning-talks][DevConf 2022]].

You can find the rendered slides here: [[https://dcermak.github.io/container-layer-sizes-presentation/container-layer-analyzer.html][dcermak.github.io/container-layer-sizes-presentation]].

** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./container-layer-analyzer.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs container-layer-analyzer.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
